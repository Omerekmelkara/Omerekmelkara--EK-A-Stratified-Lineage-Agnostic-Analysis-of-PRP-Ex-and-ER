## Project Overview

This study investigates the relationship between persulfide-related protein (PRP) expression and erastin resistance in cancer cell lines, using a stratified, lineage-agnostic framework.

The analysis integrates:
- **DepMap gene expression** and **drug screening data** wich are saved as csv files named **ERASTIN (BRD_BRD-A25004090-001-08-4) log2 fold change** and **harmonized_MS_CCLE_Gygi** in order. Both can be found in the file called "depmapdata" 
- Protein annotation matching
- Statistical modeling and visualization in R
